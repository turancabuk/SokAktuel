- This app displays product information from a JSON file, categorizing the products on the main page. The products are listed in a table view with details including "product name," "product category," "product image," and "product price." By clicking on a selected product, the user is taken to a detail screen where they can access additional information such as "country of origin," "product brand," and "listing date & time." The user can also add products to their cart by clicking the cart icon next to each product on the main page. They can view their cart by navigating to the cart screen through the tab bar and remove products by swiping left on the list. The app also includes access to menus provided by the API (locations, products, and contact) through a hamburger menu on the main page. The code was written with clean code using the MVVM architecture.
